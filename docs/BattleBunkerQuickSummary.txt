Quick-look summary
Battle Bunker markets a tough-love, military-inspired fitness culture: matte blacks, desert-tan
accents, big stencil typography, and action-packed videos that mix friendly cash-prize
challenges with serious training tips. Their gear store, YouTube comps, and “4 Weeks to Your
First Pull-up” program all reinforce a “train hard, earn rewards, join the squad”
ethos—exactly the vibe we want for a $9.99/mo Pull Up Club that grades footage and hands out
prizes. Battle BunkerYouTubeYouTubeYouTubeBattle Bunker

2. Visual & UI cues
Color palette
● #000000 / #1B1B1B — dominant backgrounds (shop + YT thumbnails). Battle Bunker
● #F5F3EE (sand) — text overlays & apparel prints. Battle Bunker
● Accent red (#E63946) or yellow-gold (#FFC65A) on CTAs/prize callouts.
YouTubeYouTube
Pull Up Club can keep the dark base but swap accent to a bold electric blue (#2D8FFF) for
differentiation while retaining high-contrast energy.
Typography
● Heavy stencil/athletic block faces are common in thumbnails and merch. Battle
BunkerYouTube
● Pair with a clean sans (Inter, Satoshi) for UI legibility.
Imagery & motion
● Slow-mo reps, chalk dust bursts, and money-drop reveals. YouTubeYouTube
● High-energy jump-cuts; graphics slide in from bottom. Perfect use-case for motion.dev
variants (slideUp, pop).
● Use Lenis for subtle parallax on hero background images—e.g., hanging pull-up bar
drifting as user scrolls.
3. Messaging & tone
Element Sample BB copy Pull Up Club adaptation
Tagline “Stronger Than Yesterday” Battle Bunker “Rep. Record. Rise.”
CTA “Beat Us In Pull-Ups, Win $1000!” YouTube “Can your reps top the board? $250
gear bounty every month.”
Voice Direct, competitive, peppered with military
slang (“send it”, “gear up”).
YouTubeYouTube
Keep command-style verbs: “Log in.
Lock on. Pull.”; sprinkle friendly
trash-talk.
4. Product & pricing insights
● BB sells $99 Deployment Packs & $25 resistance bands; value-add programs at
$19/mo. Battle BunkerBattle Bunker
● Our $9.99/mo subscription undercuts that, so emphasize exclusive judging, real
prizes, and community cred to justify the fee.
● Consider tier-upsell: Pro ($19.99) includes form-feedback videos by judges.

First, here is the response for the POD:
The Purpose of Pull-Up Club
Pull-Up Club exists to build a community-driven fitness challenge centered around pull-ups. It
empowers individuals to compete, share progress, and celebrate growth, no matter their skill
level, by submitting videos, tracking reps, and earning recognition. The mission is to foster
consistency, accountability, and camaraderie through a simple but powerful movement: the
pull-up.
Three Desired Outcomes for Users
1. Track Progress & Improve Performance
Users can consistently log their pull-up reps, see how they rank over time, and push
themselves to new personal records.
2. Earn Recognition & Motivation
Through badges, leaderboards, and club tiers, users get tangible milestones that
celebrate their achievements and fuel ongoing motivation.
3. Connect with a Like-Minded Community
By sharing videos and joining clubs, users engage with others chasing similar goals,
creating a social layer that keeps them inspired and accountable.
Three Clear Objectives or Goals for the Site
1. Seamless Submission & Verification System
Enables users to easily submit pull-up videos via Typeform (linked to Stripe payments
and Supabase backend) with logic-driven filtering to validate and sort entries.
2. Dynamic Leaderboard & Club Sorting
Provide users with real-time leaderboards that display top performers and club
members filtered by reps, location, tier, and badges.
3. Incentivized Participation through Gamification
Use achievements (badges), tiers (clubs), and challenges to keep users engaged,
returning regularly, and striving for improvement.
